# NeuroSaarthi – AR + AI for Neurodiversity Awareness and Support

## Vision

NeuroSaarthi is a first-of-its-kind platform that revolutionizes how neurodiversity is understood and supported in India. Instead of relying on static information, NeuroSaarthi offers immersive learning, real-time AI support, and inclusive tools tailored for:

- Parents  
- Educators  
- Neurodiverse individuals  

By combining Augmented Reality (AR) and Generative AI, the platform fosters empathy, reduces stigma, and helps build inclusive environments in homes and schools.

## Why NeuroSaarthi Matters

- **1 in 8 children in India** may be neurodivergent (Autism, ADHD, Dyslexia, etc.).
- Lack of awareness often leads to misdiagnosis and mistreatment.
- There is no existing unified platform in India integrating AR experiences with GenAI-driven insights.
- NeuroSaarthi fills this critical gap by providing personalized, accessible, and impactful tools.
